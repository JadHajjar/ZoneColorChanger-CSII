# Zone Color Changer
Customise the color of zone blocks, as well as the transparency of the blocks' borders and fill.


## How to use
Access the Zone Color Changer panel by clicking on the "Edit Zone Colors" button inside the zones tool-bar.

Change color mode with the drop-down at the top, or just change individual colors of zones.


If you want to reset the colors, just switch back the mode to Default, or one of the color blind options.


## Notes
* The mod dynamically gathers zone types. So custom zones generated by mods, as well as future zones that come to the game, will automatically show up in Zone Color Changer.


Thank you to Trejak and YenYang for helping out with the UI elements.
